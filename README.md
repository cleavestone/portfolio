# 🧠 My Streamlit Portfolio

Welcome to my **Streamlit Portfolio** — a personal project that not only showcases my work and skills in data and AI but also serves as a learning ground for mastering Streamlit and interactive app development.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This portfolio is a **Streamlit web application** designed to present my:
- 🧪 Data Science & Machine Learning Projects
- 🗄 SQL and Data Analysis Work
- 📊 Power BI Dashboards (linked or embedded)
- 🤖 Generative AI & LLM Demos

It’s **fully interactive**, easy to navigate, and deployable — reflecting my evolving skill set in both **frontend tooling** and **backend logic**.

---

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11**
- **Streamlit**
- **Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn** (depending on the project)
- **HTML/CSS** (for styling components)
- **Git & GitHub** for version control
- **Streamlit Cloud** for deployment

---

## 🎯 Goals of This Project

- ✅ Create a clean and dynamic portfolio to demonstrate my work
- ✅ Deepen my understanding of **Streamlit layout, state management, navigation, and deployment**
- ✅ Practice integrating multiple Python modules into a single app
- ✅ Learn how to organize and serve multiple pages with custom routing

---

## 🧭 Features

- 🔀 **Multi-page navigation** (via `streamlit-multipage`)
- 🌐 Clean layout with custom sidebar or minimal UI
- 📁 Well-structured `pages/` folder — each topic (SQL, ML, LLMs) has its own module
- 📊 Embedded visualizations (matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)
- ☁️ Deployed via [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
